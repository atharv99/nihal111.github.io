I am a senior undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. I'm pursuing my a Bachelor's degree at IIT Bombay with my major in Civil Engineering and minors in Computer Science.  
  
Coding is by far my favorite hobby. I have enjoyed programming ever since I knew what it meant. I continue to learn, develop and build new things every day.  
  
In my freshman year, along with two of my friends, Akash and Arpan, I formed the Ferozepurwale hackathon team. Together we have won several prizes including- Ubisoft GameJam 1st place, Yahoo! Japan HackU Most Creative Hack, Microsoft Code.Fun.Do Showcase Finalist, Lenovo GameJam, Kandy Hackathon and Digital Ocean Campus Champ Finalist.  
  
I am an Open Source enthusiast and I strongly believe in the FOSS philosophy. I'm a contributor and organization member at [MovingBlocks- Terasology].  
  
[Terasology] is an open source Minecraft inspired tech demo and it supports various types of gameplay settings in a voxel world. In the summer of 2017, I [completed my Google Summer of Code] last summer with Terasology. I created a whole new adventure gameplay mode backed with lore and packed with puzzles, traps, Wild Animals and other fun stuff.  
  
The Web and Coding Club of IIT Bombay is like my family away from home. In my junior year (2017-18), I managed the club, leading a team of 20 sophomores as a part of one of the biggest college technical clubs in India, to conduct hobbyistic programming activities in the institute. In the past few years, we've built several things including a [wiki], a [new website], [a YouTube Channel] and even an [internship portal]. I've personally conducted several workshops and tried to foster interest in different technologies, open source and programming in general.  
  
I like to listen to rock music, specifically progressive rock, post-rock, djent and heavy metal. I enjoy watching science fiction and thrillers. I'm a football fan. Even though it's been a while since I stopped following the premier league, I play whenever I get the chance. I used to be an avid gamer but I play only occasionally now. Huge Assassins Creed and Call of Duty fan.  
  
Over the period of my stay at IIT, I have learnt a lot. I have successfully 'completed' and contributed to a few [projects].  
  
I write infrequently, check out my [blog].
