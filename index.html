<h2>About</h2>


<p>I am a senior undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. I'm pursuing my a Bachelor's degree at IIT Bombay with my major in Civil Engineering and minors in Computer Science.</p>

<p>Coding is by far my favorite hobby. I have enjoyed programming ever since I knew what it meant. I continue to learn, develop and build new things every day.</p>

<p>In my freshman year, along with two of my friends, Akash and Arpan, I formed the Ferozepurwale hackathon team. Together we have won several prizes including- Ubisoft GameJam 1st place, Yahoo! Japan HackU Most Creative Hack, Microsoft Code.Fun.Do Showcase Finalist, Lenovo GameJam, Kandy Hackathon and Digital Ocean Campus Champ Finalist.</p>

<p>I am an Open Source enthusiast and I strongly believe in the FOSS philosophy. I'm a contributor and organization member at <a href="https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology">MovingBlocks- Terasology</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://terasology.org/">Terasology</a> is an open source Minecraft inspired tech demo and it supports various types of gameplay settings in a voxel world. In the summer of 2017, I <a href="/2017/08/15/GSoC-wrap-up.html">completed my Google Summer of Code</a> last summer with Terasology. I created a whole new adventure gameplay mode backed with lore and packed with puzzles, traps, Wild Animals and other fun stuff.</p>

<p>The Web and Coding Club of IIT Bombay is like my family away from home. In my junior year (2017-18), I managed the club, leading a team of 20 sophomores as a part of one of the biggest college technical clubs in India, to conduct hobbyistic programming activities in the institute. In the past few years, we've built several things including a <a href="https://wncc-iitb.org/wiki">wiki</a>, a <a href="http://wncc-iitb.org/">new website</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs3x_XxwScIAzDUfN1lbbGw">a YouTube Channel</a> and even an <a href="https://portals.wncc-iitb.org/internships/login/">internship portal</a>. I've personally conducted several workshops and tried to foster interest in different technologies, open source and programming in general. </p>

<p>I like to listen to rock music, specifically progressive rock, post-rock, djent and heavy metal. I enjoy watching science fiction and thrillers. I'm a football fan. Even though it's been a while since I stopped following the premier league, I play whenever I get the chance. I used to be an avid gamer but I play only occasionally now. Huge Assassins Creed and Call of Duty fan.</p>

<p>Over the period of my stay at IIT, I have learnt a lot. I have successfully 'completed' and contributed to a few <a href="/projects">projects</a>.</p>

<p>I write infrequently, check out my <a href="/blog">blog</a>.</p>
